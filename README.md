## Description

Restaurant Reviews Project consists in converting a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application, responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. A service worker is also added to provide the offline usage of the app.

## Instructions

You can clone or download the app from https://github.com/tinashub/project-restaurant-reviews-v2. Please note you will need to install python from htpps://www.python.org/ if you donâ€™t have it on your machine. 
In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, start the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use), in the root folder of the downloaded app. For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`.
To run the app, with your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

This app uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to use a token provided to you by Mapbox when you register. Mapbox is free.
